# Rock, paper, scissors project

In this project I developed a web app where the user can play rock, paper, scissors games against the computer in games of 5 rounds. The app keeps track of the victories and losses of each player and displays the choices coloring the buttons.

This is the first of the The Odin Project projects where I've used Javascript along CSS and HTML. It specially has helped me getting more practice with CSS layouts, specially flexbox and got me to implement the bases of Javascript to give the program some functionality.
